# ELECTENG310 Team 16 Project 1
A documentation of project 1 in electrical engineering design.
We will be using a few softwares for documenting data and simulation process.

## Introduction
This project is making a water level detector for the water tanks.

There will be 3 phases for this project.

Phase 1 - Development of the probes

Phase 2 - Transmitter

Phase 3 - Receiver

## Softwares used
1. FEMM - used in phase 1 for selecting a suitable material for the dielectric part of the probe.
