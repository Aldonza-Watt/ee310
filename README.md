# ELECTENG310 Team 16 Project 1
A documentation of project 1 in electrical engineering design.
We will be using a few softwares for documenting data and simulation process.

## About Project
This project is making a water level detector for the water tanks.

There will be 3 phases for this project.

### Phase 1 - Development of the probes
We are given two options for the material of the dielectric of the probe (**silicone rubber and polyvinyl chloride**). To select the most suitable material of the dielectric, we had measured certain water levels of the tank.

According to online research, the maximum depth of a typical tank is **2500mm (250m)**. The diameter of the tank is 3500mm (350m).

| Water Level | Medium | Depth (mm) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% Water | Air | 3500 |
| | Water | 0 |
| 20% Water | Air | 3000 |
| | Water | 500 |
| 50% Water | Air | 2250 |
| | Water | 1250 |
|100% Water | Air | 1000 |
| | Water | 2500 |

We used FEMM software to observe and record the data of the charge Q and the stored energy E. We used the formulae to calculate the capacitance of the water tanks.

### Phase 2 - Transmitter

### Phase 3 - Receiver

## Softwares used
1. FEMM - used in phase 1 for selecting a suitable material for the dielectric part of the probe.
