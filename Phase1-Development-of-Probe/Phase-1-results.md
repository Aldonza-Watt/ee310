# Silicone Rubber vs Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
### Silicone Rubber
- An elastomer of organic silicon atoms (contains **siloxane**, an insoluble compound)
- It is soft and smooth to touch
- It rebounds to its original shape after removing an external force
- generally transparent during burning
- It is inherently self-extinguishing
- It produces amorphous white powder and a small burning

### Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
- It is a thermoplastic made from **polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers**
- It i slightly rugged and rough touch
- It has a poor rebound
- It turns black after burning
- It smells bad when burning
- It cannot withstand temperatures beyond 170&deg;F, otherwise it decomposes into hydrogen chloride

## Pros and Cons
We also researched the pros and cons of both materials.

| | Silicone Rubber | Polyvinyl Chloride |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pros | <li> Heat resistance <ul><li> has a wide temperature range <li> maintains its flexibility at temperature up to 450&deg;F </li></ul></li></ul> <li> High tensile strength <ul><li> resistant to abrasion and fatigue <li> used in several applications that require **stretching** and **reshaping** <li> ideal for extrusion and molding </li></ul> <li> Low chemical reactivity <ul><li> good chemical stability </li> <li> ideal for extreme conditions </li> <li> improves the material's resistance to ozone and weather </li></ul> <li> Inertness  | <li> |
| Cons | <ul><li> | <ul><li> |

# Results
From  our Excel spreadsheet, we have produced a graph for comparing the trends between water level and the capacitance used for detecting the frequency and water level of the tank.
